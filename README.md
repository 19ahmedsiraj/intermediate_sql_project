# üß© Contoso Sales Analytics Project
## üß† Overview

The Contoso Sales Analytics Project leverages transactional and customer data to provide actionable business insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability patterns. Using PostgreSQL for data processing, this project demonstrates how structured queries and analytical views can aggregate and segment customer-level transactions, enabling a deeper understanding of customer lifetime value (LTV).

By constructing cohort-based views and calculating percentile-based customer segments, the project identifies low, mid, and high-value customers, revealing which segments drive revenue and where potential growth opportunities exist. The analysis also highlights the Pareto principle in customer behavior, showing that a relatively small portion of customers contributes disproportionately to total revenue.

This approach integrates data-driven segmentation with strategic business recommendations, providing a foundation for targeted marketing campaigns, personalized retention strategies, and operational decision-making.

## üìä Business Questions

### 1. Customer Segmentation:
Customer segmentation based on total net revenue (LTV ‚Äì Lifetime Value) using percentile thresholds.

### üß© Query Breakdown

#### Step 1 ‚Äì Base View: cohort_analysis

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.cohort_analysis AS
WITH revenue_table AS (
  SELECT
    s.customerkey,
    s.orderdate,
    SUM(s.quantity::double precision * s.netprice / s.exchangerate) AS total_net_revenue,
    COUNT(s.orderkey) AS no_of_orders
  FROM sales s
  GROUP BY s.customerkey, s.orderdate
)
SELECT
  rt.customerkey,
  rt.orderdate,
  rt.total_net_revenue,
  rt.no_of_orders,
  MIN(rt.orderdate) OVER (PARTITION BY rt.customerkey) AS first_order_date,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM MIN(rt.orderdate) OVER (PARTITION BY rt.customerkey)) AS cohort_year,
  c.countryfull,
  c.age,
  c.givenname,
  c.surname
FROM revenue_table rt
LEFT JOIN customer c ON rt.customerkey = c.customerkey;
```
#### Purpose:

Builds a customer-level dataset linking each customer‚Äôs transactions and their first purchase date (used for cohort identification).

#### Step 2 ‚Äì Compute LTV per Customer
```sql
customer_ltvs AS (
  SELECT 
    ca.customerkey,
    ca.cleaned_name,
    SUM(ca.total_net_revenue) AS customer_ltv
  FROM cohort_analysis ca
  GROUP BY ca.customerkey, ca.cleaned_name
)
```
#### Purpose:

Aggregates all transactions for each customer into their Lifetime Value (LTV) = total net revenue generated.

#### Step 3 ‚Äì Determine Percentile Thresholds
```sql
segmentation AS (
  SELECT 
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY customer_ltv) AS ltv_25th_percentile,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY customer_ltv) AS ltv_75th_percentile
  FROM customer_ltvs
)
```
#### Purpose:

* Uses SQL‚Äôs PERCENTILE_CONT to compute the 25th and 75th percentiles of customer LTV.

* These thresholds will define the LOW, MID, and HIGH segments.
#### Step 4 ‚Äì Segment Customers
```sql
customers_seg AS (
  SELECT 
    l.*,
    CASE
      WHEN l.customer_ltv <= s.ltv_25th_percentile THEN '1-LOW'
      WHEN l.customer_ltv > s.ltv_75th_percentile THEN '3-HIGH'
      ELSE '2-MID'
    END AS customer_segment
  FROM customer_ltvs l, segmentation s
)
```
#### Purpose:

Categorizes each customer into:

* 1-LOW ‚Üí bottom 25%

* 2-MID ‚Üí middle 50%

* 3-HIGH ‚Üí top 25%

#### Step 5 ‚Äì Aggregate Segment Insights
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_segment,
  COUNT(customerkey) AS customers_count,
  SUM(customer_ltv) AS total_ltv,
  SUM(customer_ltv)/COUNT(customerkey) AS avg_ltv
FROM customers_seg
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY customer_segment;
```
#### Purpose:

* Summarizes key metrics per segment:

* Customers count per tier

* Total LTV contribution

| Segment    | Customers Count | Total LTV (Sales) | Average LTV |
| ---------- | --------------: | ----------------: | ----------: |
| **1-LOW**  |          12,372 |         4,298,367 |         347 |
| **2-MID**  |          24,743 |        66,367,810 |       2,682 |
| **3-HIGH** |          12,372 |       135,606,969 |      10,961 |

#### üìà Revenue Contribution by Customer Segment

### üìä Analysis

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Low-Value Customers (1-LOW)

* Represents: ~25% of total customer base (12,372 out of ~49,000).

* Revenue Contribution: ~2% of total LTV.

* Average LTV: Only $347 per customer ‚Äî very low spenders.

* Insight: Large in number, but minimal contribution. Possibly one-time or low-engagement buyers.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mid-Value Customers (2-MID)

* Represents: ~50% of customers (24,743).

* Revenue Contribution: ~32% of total LTV.

* Average LTV: $2,682, meaning moderate engagement and purchasing consistency.

* Insight: This segment drives consistent sales volume ‚Äî great potential for upselling and loyalty conversion.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ High-Value Customers (3-HIGH)

* Represents: ~25% of customers (12,372).

* Revenue Contribution: ~66% of total LTV!

* Average LTV: $10,961 per customer ‚Äî nearly 32√ó higher than low-value customers.

* Insight: Classic Pareto principle (80/20 rule) ‚Äî a small group generates the majority of revenue.

* Losing even a small portion of these customers would significantly impact revenue.

### üß≠ Strategic Recommendations

#### üéØ For High-Value Customers (Top 25%)

* Implement exclusive loyalty programs (priority service, rewards, early access).

* Use personalized retention campaigns ‚Äî predictive churn analysis can help identify drop risks.

* Maintain premium experiences ‚Äî avoid price sensitivity.

#### ‚ö° For Mid-Value Customers (Middle 50%)

* Focus on upselling and cross-selling (e.g., complementary products).

* Offer tier-based rewards to incentivize higher spending.

* Send personalized product recommendations based on past behavior.

#### ü™Ñ For Low-Value Customers (Bottom 25%)

* Run re-engagement campaigns (discounts, first-time bundles).

* Simplify checkout or subscription plans to reduce drop-offs.

* Identify whether they are new or churned users ‚Äî tailor communication accordingly.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that Contoso‚Äôs revenue is heavily concentrated among high-value customers, who represent 25% of the customer base but contribute 66% of total LTV. Mid-value customers represent a stable source of revenue, while low-value customers, though large in number, contribute minimally to overall sales.

Key takeaways include:

* High-value customers require priority retention efforts and personalized engagement to prevent revenue loss.

* Mid-value customers represent growth potential through upselling, cross-selling, and loyalty initiatives.

* Low-value customers can be targeted with re-engagement strategies to increase their lifetime value.

Overall, the project highlights the importance of data-driven customer segmentation for optimizing marketing, sales, and retention strategies. It also demonstrates how combining SQL analytics with visualization and reporting can provide actionable insights for business decision-making, aligning operational priorities with revenue maximization.
